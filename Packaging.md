Leiningen is available in a number of package managers:

Many package managers still include version 1.x, which is rather
outdated, so you may be better off installing manually as explained in
the [README](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/README.md).
Please note that all of these are 3rd-party releases not supported by the
Leiningen team.

* [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/tools/build-managers/leiningen/default.nix)
* [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/leiningen.rb)
* [yum](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/leiningen/overview/)
* [Arch AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/leiningen2-git)
* [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/packages/lein) (Windows)
* [FreeBSD Ports](http://www.freshports.org/devel/leiningen/)
* [Gentoo](http://gpo.zugaina.org/dev-lang/leiningen-bin) (it is not official at the moment, available only in overlay)

Leiningen 1.x was available in apt-get at one point, but it has been
removed from recent releases, being too old to actually be
beneficial. There is a 3rd-party [PPA release](https://launchpad.net/~mikegedelman/+archive/ubuntu/leiningen-git-stable) available.
