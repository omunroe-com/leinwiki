Leiningen is available in a number of package managers:

Many package managers still include version 1.x, which is rather
outdated, so you may be better off installing manually as explained in
the [README](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/README.md).

* [nix](https://nixos.org/websvn/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/development/tools/build-managers/leiningen/default.nix)
* [apt-get](http://packages.debian.org/sid/leiningen) (Debian: since wheezy; Ubuntu: since Oneiric; 1.x only)
* [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/leiningen.rb) (2.2.0)
* [yum](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Clojure) (in progress)
