This page assumes you have already installed and configured clojure-mode, swank-clojure, slime. It also assumes you've followed the Leiningen hacking instructions and are using the master branch.

From your Leiningen checkout directory run the following:

<pre class="console">
$ cd lein-swank
$ lein-stable install
</pre>

Once this is installed you can test it with:

<pre class="console">
$ lein swank
</pre>

A REPL should get started up on port 4005. Launch Emacs. Once Emacs is up and running type *M-x slime-connect*. Use the default settings. You're now connected to a Clojure REPL with a properly configured classpath.
