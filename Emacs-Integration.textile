This page assumes you have already installed and configured clojure-mode, swank-clojure, slime. It also assumes you've followed the Leiningen hacking instructions and are using the master branch.

You should make sure your *project.clj* file looks something like this:

<pre>
(defproject my-project "0.1.0"
  :description "My great Clojure project"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT"]
                 [org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
  :dev-dependencies [[leiningen/lein-swank "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]])
</pre>

Then from your project directory you can run the following:

<pre class="console">
$ lein swank
</pre>

A REPL should get started up on port 4005. Launch Emacs. Once Emacs is up and running type *M-x slime-connect*. Use the default settings. You're now connected to a Clojure REPL with a properly configured classpath.
