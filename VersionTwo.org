* Version Two
  This is our chance to make backwards-incompatible restructurings and
  refactorings, so let's make the most of it. Brainstorm here.

* Open Questions
  - dev as a bit vs arbitrary environments/profiles
    - what is an environment? what varies?
      - config files
      - dependencies
      - classpath!
      - test selectors?
      - hooks?
      - source environment variables?
      - arbitrary defproject keys?
  - Do people use shell wrappers?
  - First-class support for subtasks?
  - Do we need to keep maven around for pom generation?
    - Is it feasible to just use simple XML generation?

* Internal Changes
  - Upgrade to Clojure 1.3
  - Switch from maven-ant-tasks to Aether
    Should allow us to clean up a lot.
  - Place all artifacts inside target/ directory
  - Require a project argument for all tasks
    even ones that run outside a project; determine if project is
    required via metadata instead of inspecting arglists

* Features
  - Run projects inside in-process subclassloader
    - allow for :eval-in :subprocess or :eval-in :leiningen
    - recalculate dependencies without restarting (pomegranate style)
  - Support classifiers to specify Clojure versions?
  - Non-transitive AOT when possible (1.4+)
  - "lein compile :lint" to turn on reflection warnings etc.
  - Namespace-level test selectors
  - Allow more extensible jarring multimethods
    http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/browse_thread/thread/50b1198e2fbd0d6b
  - Spin off leiningen-core library
    - Who will use this?
    - What should be moved?
      - classpath calculation
      - eval-in-project
        - is leiningen.compile/prep going to be a problem?
      - read-project
      - user-settings?
      - repositories-for
      - find-deps-files
  - Templates for new projects (a la spawn plugin)
  - Allow tasks to declare themselves as idempotent

* Deprecations
  - Consider dropping Ant as a dependency.
    (might need it for javac task)
  - :local-repo-classpath by default
  - Dependency checksum mismatch should cause failure by default
  - Remove symlink lib option
  - Remove test! task
  - Remove bundled lancet
  - Remove :test-resources-path and :jar-dir
  - Remove special-casing for group-id for org.clojure deps
  - Spin off repl socket server into a plugin?
  - Deprecate interactive task in favour of Jark?
    (assuming Jark is ready)
  - Drop Clojars snapshots from default repo list
