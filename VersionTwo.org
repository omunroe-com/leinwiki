* Version Two
  This is our chance to make backwards-incompatible restructurings and
  refactorings, so let's make the most of it. Brainstorm here.

* Refactoring
  - Upgrade to Clojure 1.3
  - Switch from maven-ant-tasks to Aether
    Should allow us to clean up a lot.
  - Place all artifacts inside target/ directory
  - Require a project argument for all tasks
    even ones that run outside a project; determine if project is
    required via metadata instead of inspecting arglists.

* Features
  - Run projects inside in-process subclassloader
    - allow for :eval-in :subprocess or :eval-in :leiningen
  - Allow more extensible jarring multimethods
    http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/browse_thread/thread/50b1198e2fbd0d6b
  - Spin off leiningen-core library
    - need to brainstorm about what belongs here
  - Templates for new projects (a la spawn plugin)

* Deprecations
  - Consider dropping Ant as a dependency.
    (might need it for javac task)
  - :checksum-deps by default
  - :local-repo-classpath by default
  - Deprecate interactive task in favour of Jark?
    (assuming Jark is ready)
  - Drop Clojars snapshots from default repo list
